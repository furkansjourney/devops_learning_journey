## Day 03 – File Viewing & Log Basics

Today I practiced basic Linux file viewing and log inspection commands:

- `cat`, `head`, `tail`
- `more` vs `less`
- `tail -f` for live log monitoring
- `grep` for filtering errors
- Using pipes (`|`) to combine commands

Focused on hands-on terminal practice and real-life log reading scenarios.
