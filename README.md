# DevOps Learning Journey (Linux → Kubernetes/CKA)

Hi, I’m Furkan Çetin. This repository documents my hands-on DevOps learning path with daily notes, practice logs, and weekly summaries.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals in Linux and Kubernetes and prepare for the CKA exam with consistent practice.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build solid **Linux fundamentals** (commands, permissions, processes, networking)
- Learn **Kubernetes** step-by-step (YAML, Pods, Deployments, Services, storage, troubleshooting)
- Keep a consistent **study log** (what I studied, how long, what I practiced)
- Produce a clear portfolio of learning & discipline

## 📌 How to Use This Repo
- **Daily notes**: short and practical (`what / how long / commands / examples`)
- **Weekly summaries**: what improved, what’s missing, next week plan
- **Hands-on first**: every topic includes terminal practice or small tasks
